  <h1>Ethiopian Coffee</h1>

<p>
  Ethiopian coffee, also known as “bunna”, is a huge part of Ethiopian culture and one of my favourite things in the world. It is more than just a drink it is tradition, community, and comfort. In Ethiopia, coffee is prepared through a beautiful ceremony that begins with washing and roasting fresh green beans. As the beans roast, a rich aroma fills the room, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.
  <br><br>
  The roasted beans are then ground by hand using a mortar and pestle before being brewed in a clay pot called a <em>jebena</em>. Coffee is served in three rounds: <strong>abol</strong>, <strong>tona</strong>, and <strong>baraka</strong>, each cup symbolising respect, connection, and blessing. Families, friends, and neighbours often gather to talk, laugh, and share stories while enjoying the ceremony. For me, Ethiopian coffee reminds me of home, togetherness, and the beauty of slowing down to appreciate small moments.
